## Android Media related stuff
 A series of small Demo for media related api on android platform , including ExoPlayer, camera2 , mediaPlayerBack, etc.... All of which rely on android's hardware layer support. Just a small piece of draft.

1. Camera2 Api demo
- Camera 2 API use case(Not done yet)
Note: I'm  too lazy to write that bunch of Permission Check BoilerPlate Code , so Please grant all permission required: Camera,disk and that kind of stuff if you are on an Marshmallow Device

Note! quote from [Google's guide](https://google.github.io/ExoPlayer/faqs.html) :
> ### Does ExoPlayer support emulators?
>
> If you’re seeing ExoPlayer fail when using an emulator,
> this is usually because the emulator does not properly implement components of Android’s media stack.
> This is an issue with the emulator, not with ExoPlayer. Android’s official emulator (“Virtual Devices” in Android Studio)
> supports ExoPlayer provided the system image has an API level of at least 23. System images with earlier API levels do not support ExoPlayer.
> The level of support provided by third party emulators varies. If you find a third party emulator on which ExoPlayer fails,
> you should report this to the developer of the emulator rather than to the ExoPlayer team. Where possible,
> we recommend testing media applications on physical devices rather than emulators.

> SurfaceView are more performant than textureView ,the latter is shall only be used as media output when scrolling or animation are required.

4. A demo bestow the superiority of ThreadPool handling intense request ,not very interesting ,though some concurrency issues are worth learning
